* 8bab2062 preloading threads.pm is absolute bullshit - remove and find out
the real problem (might very well be a Moo bug). But seriously - preloading
threads.pm in a BEGIN block?!?!?!
* 50e6c52e reenable the test and investigate. A blatant skip is fucking
bullshit
* a0361822 reenable the win32 test - if it no longer fails for anyone - how
will we ever fix it?
* 461c7168 has two places where it sets a brand new lexical to undef. Please
remove for the sanity of future maintainers (avoid the "why is this here?!")
* abfc6aca ignores README - it should never appear during normal operation
if it does - something got fucked at the distbuilding stage
* 571df676 adds a bugs.t - please rename the test to something sensible
* a48693f4 adds 5 files for a test that may even be the same as that from
571df676 - please rewrite using the existing schema and delete the rest
